          <p>Be it a latte, flat white, skinny macchiato, or just good old black coffee, we’ve all got our morning muse. Coffee has by far become the world’s favourite drink and according to <a href="https://www.gimokacoffee.com/news/coffee-in-the-uk-infographic.html">Gimoka Coffee</a>, there are now an estimated 16,501 coffee outlets in the UK. It is a market that's growing by more than 10% each year, with Britons gradually drinking more coffee over its traditional British cousin, tea, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/04/why-the-british-are-drinking-coffee-instead-of-tea/?utm_term=.4d61b5a65cc4">especially amongst millennials.</a> </p>
          <p>A study by <a href="https://www.honestcoffees.com/blog/coffee-shops-vs-pubs/">Honest Coffees</a> has found that the ratio between coffee shops and pubs is now becoming more even, where in the past the pub would have reigned King. London has a 44% to 56% split between coffee shops and boozers, showing us brits are increasingly craving the caffeine over the Carlsberg.</p>

            <p>From the extent of our coffee consumption, we can expect a considerable amount of waste grounds to be produced. In fact, the UK produces around half a million tonnes of waste coffee grounds every year - now that’s a lot of coffee. </p>
            <p>This didn’t go unnoticed by entrepreneur Arthur Kay, who in 2014 won the European Environmental Prize. Kay was awarded £400,000, which would later enable him to build his start-up eco business <a href="http://www.bio-bean.com/"><em>‘bio-bean’.</em></a></p>
            <p>In 2015, <em>bio-bean</em> founded the world’s first coffee recycling factory in Cambridgeshire, to recycle grounds into ecological biofuels. The factory now has the capacity to recycle more than 500,000 tonnes of coffee every year.</p>
            <p>Since opening the factory, Kay has developed pioneering eco products from waste coffee such as ‘Coffee Logs’ and biodiesel.</p>

                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p><em>bio-bean</em> have partnered with numerous waste service providers to collect the coffee grounds, including <em>The Coffee Recycling Co.</em> which carries out collections in the North West.</p>
                <p>Waste bins and caddies are sent to cafés, restaurants and businesses for them to dispose of their spent coffee grounds. Louis Morris, at <em>The Coffee Recycling Co.</em> says: “We offer two types of service. A 23-litre coffee caddie that’s priced at £4.35+VAT per collection, or a 120-litre coffee bin that we charge at £9.00+VAT per collection.” </p>
                <p>Due to the landfill tax (at £85 per tonne), waste management companies are now charging companies more to collect their waste, therefore, this charge is understood to save businesses money on their waste coffee collection.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "We're proud to recycle 100% of our grounds"  <br> - <em>Dan Thorpe, Broderick's</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p><em>Costa</em> is the largest coffee shop chain to use the services. However, hundreds of smaller businesses also take part. <em>Broderick’s Love Coffee</em>, an independent coffee shop chain operating in Manchester, including Manchester Airport, uses <em>The Coffee Recycling Co.</em> </p>

                <p>Dan Thorpe, Manager at the Manchester Airport branch of <em>Broderick’s</em>, says: “It’s great to see our waste coffee being transformed into something beneficial. We’re proud to recycle 100% of our grounds.”</p>
                <p>Collection of the bins runs on a planned collection route, to minimise mileage making the process more ecological. They are then taken to the <em>bio-bean</em> factory to be transformed into a range of coffee-derived biofuels. </p>

            <h2>Coffee Logs</h2>
            <p>In 2016 <em>bio-bean</em> launched their first consumer product ‘Coffee Logs’, which are eco heat logs for stoves, open fires and chimineas. Each individual log is made from 25 cups of recycled coffee, which has been dried and compressed.</p>
            <p>Pippa Henderson, Marketing and Communications Executive at <em>bio-bean</em> says: “We add a small amount of sawdust that’s a waste product sourced locally to our Alconbury factory, which helps the logs bind. The logs are also coated in wax, which makes them easier to handle and acts as an ignition agent." </p>

            </figure>

            <p>When burnt, Henderson says, the Coffee Logs burn hotter and for longer. “They burn very similarly to wood logs and woody briquettes in terms of emissions. Because coffee is highly calorific, Coffee Logs contain about 20% more energy than wood, which means they offer a hotter and longer burn,” she says.</p>
            <p>Consumers, like Daniel Sharp, report a distinct coffee scent whilst burning the logs, as well as an impressive heat output for their size.</p>
            <p>The logs, which are available to buy at <em>Morrisons, Ocado, Amazon</em> and other smaller independent stores, reached sales of more than 50,000 bags in 2017 alone - a remarkable 20,000,000 coffees worth of grounds.</p>

<section class="body">
          <h2>Biodiesel</h2>
          <p>In 2017, <em>bio-bean</em> partnered with fuel giants <em>Shell</em> and <em>Argent Energy</em> to produce a coffee-derived fuel called B20 biofuel. Once the grounds are collected, they are dried and processed to extract coffee oil. The oil is then blended with other fats and oils to create a 20% biocomponent, which is then mixed with a mineral diesel. </p>
          <p>The biodiesel has formed part of <em>Shell's</em> “#makethefuture” initiative, and claims the 6,000 litres of coffee oil they have produced to date, has enabled <em>Argent Energy</em> to generate 30,000 litres of biodiesel. On a large scale, they say, the coffee oil could contribute towards fuelling up to a third of London’s bus fleet. </p>

            <h2>Towards a sustainable future</h2>

            <p>As ingenious as the idea is, how truly eco-friendly is coffee recycling?</p>
            <p>Well, landfill remains one of our main sources of waste disposal in the UK, despite its decrease in the last 10 years thanks to targets set by the EU. <em>bio-bean</em> claim that their coffee recycling helps to reduce this method of waste by ensuring coffee grounds don’t end up part of it.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Our processes actually create 60% less emissions than sending the waste coffee to landfill"  <br> - <em>Pippa Henderson, bio-bean</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Because of this, they say that their recycling reduces CO2 emissions from landfill, meaning it helps to reduce the production of greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming. Henderson says: “Our processes actually create 60% less emissions than sending the waste coffee to landfill and 30% less emissions than sending the coffee to anaerobic digestion with food waste.</p>
            <p>“An additional benefit comes from displacing less environmentally fuels like coal and imported wood logs, by using Coffee Logs, which further reduces emissions,” she says.</p>
            <p>Although their biodiesel is cleaner than traditional fossil fuels, it still needs to be made up of 80% fossil fuel to be useable for transport. But whilst these biofuels may appear more environmentally friendly, we also have to think how coffee beans reach coffee shops and into our cups in the first place. The UK imports coffee mainly from Brazil, Vietnam and Indonesia, which takes large amounts of transport miles. </p>
            <p>But despite this, recycling waste products like <em>bio-bean</em>, is a great initiative and is definitely a step in the right direction to reducing our mark on the environment.</p>
